/// Map is a lexicographically ordered map from byte strings to integers.
///
/// A `Map` is constructed with the `MapBuilder` type. Alternatively, a `Map`
/// can be constructed in memory from a lexicographically ordered iterator
/// of key-value pairs (`Map::from_iter`).
///
/// A key feature of `Map` is that it can be serialized to disk compactly. Its
/// underlying representation is built such that the `Map` can be memory mapped
/// (`Map::from_path`) and searched without necessarily loading the entire
/// map into memory.
///
/// It supports most common operations associated with maps, such as key
/// lookup and search. It also supports set operations on its keys along with
/// the ability to specify how conflicting values are merged together. Maps
/// also support range queries and automata based searches (e.g. a regular
/// expression).
///
/// Maps are represented by a finite state transducer where inputs are the keys
/// and outputs are the values. As such, maps have the following invariants:
///
/// 1. Once constructed, a `Map` can never be modified.
/// 2. Maps must be constructed with lexicographically ordered byte sequences.
///    There is no restricting on the ordering of values.
///
/// # Differences with sets
///
/// Maps and sets are represented by the same underlying data structure: the
/// finite state transducer. The principal difference between them is that
/// sets always have their output values set to `0`. This has an impact on the
/// representation size and is reflected in the type system for convenience.
/// A secondary but subtle difference is that duplicate values can be added
/// to a set, but it is an error to do so with maps. That is, a set can have
/// the same key added sequentially, but a map can't.
///
/// # The future
///
/// It is regrettable that the output value is fixed to `u64`. Indeed, it is
/// not necessary, but it was a major simplification in the implementation.
/// In the future, the value type may become generic to an extent (outputs must
/// satisfy a basic algebra).
///
/// Keys will always be byte strings; however, we may grow more conveniences
/// around dealing with them (such as a serialization/deserialization step,
/// although it isn't clear where exactly this should live).

/// A builder for creating a map.

/// This is not your average everyday builder. It has two important qualities
/// that make it a bit unique from what you might expect:
///
/// 1. All keys must be added in lexicographic order. Adding a key out of order
///    will result in an error. Additionally, adding a duplicate key will also
///    result in an error. That is, once a key is associated with a value,
///    that association can never be modified or deleted.
/// 2. The representation of a map is streamed to *any* `io::Write` as it is
///    built. For an in memory representation, this can be a `Vec<u8>`.
///
/// Point (2) is especially important because it means that a map can be
/// constructed *without storing the entire map in memory*. Namely, since it
/// works with any `io::Write`, it can be streamed directly to a file.
///
/// With that said, the builder does use memory, but **memory usage is bounded
/// to a constant size**. The amount of memory used trades off with the
/// compression ratio. Currently, the implementation hard codes this trade off
/// which can result in about 5-20MB of heap usage during construction. (N.B.
/// Guaranteeing a maximal compression ratio requires memory proportional to
/// the size of the map, which defeats some of the benefit of streaming
/// it to disk. In practice, a small bounded amount of memory achieves
/// close-to-minimal compression ratios.)
///
/// The algorithmic complexity of map construction is `O(n)` where `n` is the
/// number of elements added to the map.
///
/// # Example: build in memory
///
/// This shows how to use the builder to construct a map in memory. Note that
/// `Map::from_iter` provides a convenience function that achieves this same
/// goal without needing to explicitly use `MapBuilder`.
///
/// ```rust
/// use fst::{IntoStreamer, Streamer, Map, MapBuilder};

/// let mut build = MapBuilder::memory();
/// build.insert("bruce", 1).unwrap();
/// build.insert("clarence", 2).unwrap();
