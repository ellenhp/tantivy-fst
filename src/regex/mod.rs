/// A regular expression for searching FSTs with Unicode support.
///
/// Regular expressions are compiled down to a deterministic finite automaton
/// that can efficiently search any finite state transducer. Notably, most
/// regular expressions only need to explore a small portion of a finite state
/// transducer without loading all of it into memory.
///
/// # Syntax
///
/// `Regex` supports fully featured regular expressions. Namely, it supports
/// all of the same constructs as the standard `regex` crate except for the
/// following things:
///
/// 1. Lazy quantifiers, since a regular expression automaton only reports
///    whether a key matches at all, and not its location. Namely, lazy
///    quantifiers such as `+?` only modify the location of a match, but never
///    change a non-match into a match or a match into a non-match.
/// 2. Word boundaries (i.e., `\b`). Because such things are hard to do in
///    a deterministic finite automaton, but not impossible. As such, these
///    may be allowed some day.
/// 3. Other zero width assertions like `^` and `$`. These are easier to
///    support than word boundaries, but are still tricky and usually aren't
///    as useful when searching dictionaries.
///
/// Otherwise, the [full syntax of the `regex`
/// crate](http://doc.rust-lang.org/regex/regex/index.html#syntax)
/// is supported. This includes all Unicode support and relevant flags.
/// (The `U` and `m` flags are no-ops because of (1) and (3) above,
/// respectively.)
///
/// # Matching semantics
///
/// A regular expression matches a key in a finite state transducer if and only
/// if it matches from the start of a key all the way to end. Stated
/// differently, every regular expression `(re)` is matched as if it were
/// `^(re)$`. This means that if you want to do a substring match, then you
/// must use `.*substring.*`.
///
/// **Caution**: Starting a regular expression with `.*` means that it could
/// potentially match *any* key in a finite state transducer. This implies that
/// all keys could be visited, which could be slow. It is possible that this
/// crate will grow facilities for detecting regular expressions that will
/// scan a large portion of a transducer and optionally disallow them.
///
