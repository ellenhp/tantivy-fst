/// # Overview of types
///
/// `Map` is a read only interface to pre-constructed sets. `MapBuilder` is
/// used to create new sets. (Once a set is created, it can never be modified.)
/// `Stream`, `Keys` and `Values` are streams that originated from a map.
/// `StreamBuilder` builds range queries. `OpBuilder` collects a set of streams
/// and executes set operations like `union` or `intersection` on them with the
/// option of specifying a merge strategy for a map's values. The rest of the
/// types are streams for set operations.
